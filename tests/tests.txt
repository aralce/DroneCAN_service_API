Test to implement:

test libcanard wrapper:



- ##batteryInfo message is published once.
- when batteryInfo is published and CAN_message is sent.
- when batteryInfo is published CAN_message is sent and beginPacket fails.
- when batteryInfo is published CAN_message is sent and endPacket fails.



Done:
- The user checks if the system is healthy and the system is healthy.

Publish:
- when batteryInfo is published, the canardBroadcast is called with the message and message_length from encodeMessage
- when batteryInfo is published, the canard function to encodeMessage is called with batteryInfo message
- when batteryInfo is published, the canardBroadcast is called with correct ID and signature.
- when batteryInfo is published, the canardBroadcast is called with the correct priority

Initialization
- The user checks if the system is healthy after a failed initialization.
- When DroneCan_service inits the libcanard library is initialized.
- When DroneCan_service inits the can bus is initialized.
